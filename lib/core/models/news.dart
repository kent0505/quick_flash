        '1989 Mercedes-Benz 300TE For Sale on Bring a Trailer Has Hollywood and Diplomatic History',
    body:
        'Shirley Temple, the iconic child actress of the 1930s and 1940s, is famous for many things. The song On the Good Ship Lollipop. Tap-dancing with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson. The teeth-crackingly sweet non-alcoholic drink that bore her name—a limited-edition commercial version of which has just been launched under the 7Up brand. But perhaps you didn\'t know that Shirley was the U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and you may be surprised to see what she brought back with her from that work.\n\nIt\'s this 1989 Mercedes-Benz 300TE wagon, which is now up for auction on Bring a Trailer (which, like Car and Driver, is part of the Hearst Autos). Built at a time when Mercedes cars were famously over-engineered, the W124 series (wagon models carry the S124 codename) is a masterpiece. This example is a utilitarian spec not offered in the United States, with crank windows, manual seats, and cloth upholstery. The smooth and durable inline-six is paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. Finished in light ivory, it could have been a taxicab in Europe (many were), but the U.S. diplomatic flag on the right front fender tells a different story.\n\nMarried in 1950 and thus now Shirley Temple Black, this was Shirley\'s personal vehicle right through her three years as U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.\n\nHer path to politics started with Henry Kissinger, who ended up convincing Richard Nixon to appoint her as a delegate to the UN in 1969. Later, George H.W. Bush appointed her Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, a position she may have sought because she happened to be in Prague in 1968 when the Soviet tanks came rolling in to crush dissent. While Ambassador, Temple Black championed anti-communist activists and was part of establishing formal diplomatic relations with the democratically elected government of Václev Havel. She personally accompanied Havel to the U.S. for his first visit.\n\nThe 300TE was brought into the States in the early 1990s and federalized at what must have been considerable expense. Shirley owned this car until she died in 2014, so she clearly had some affection for it. After a young life spent in the very public spotlight, the 300TE\'s subtlety must have let her pass unnoticed, besides being associated with her foreign service days.\n\nCelebrity cars are a funny business, as simply being owned by a famous person can add tremendously to a car\'s value—or not at all. There\'s no reserve on the auction, so the market will decide whether the Shirley Temple ownership bring a premium, but regardless, someone is going to go home with a Mercedes that has a great story attached to it.And once they do, they can load the cargo area with a crate of 7 Up\'s new Shirley Temple softdrink. Here\'s to you, Shirley.\n\nThe auction ends on October 23.',

    title: '2025 Porsche 911 GT3 Still Makes 502 HP, Gains Weissach Package',
    body:
        'Porsche\'s track-ready 911 sports car receives several small upgrades for 2025, from a revised suspension to a new lightweight package and optional rear seats.\n\nThe 2025 Porsche 911 GT3 wears revised styling and is now offered with the lightweight Weissach package.\n\nThe 4.0-liter flat-six still pumps out 502 horsepower, but torque drops from 346 pound-feet to 331.\n\nDeliveries will start next summer, with the base price rising by nearly \$40,000 to \$224,495.\n\nPorsche sprinkled the iconic 911 sports car with a handful of styling changes for 2025, along with introducing a hybrid powertrain for the first time in the GTS model. Now Porsche is updating the track-ready 911 GT3 with similarly sharp looks, revised suspension, and new lightweight bucket seats. For the first time, Porsche will also offer the GT3 with the weight-saving Weissach package.\n\nBusiness as Usual\n\nThe design changes, in typical Porsche fashion, are subtle. The front end has been tweaked with a new spoiler and underbody fins to increase downforce, and the LED headlights are restyled and can be ordered with a white accent ring. Porsche also consolidated all of the lighting functions into the main headlight unit so there is no longer a supplemental LED strip in the bumper, allowing for a larger air intake. The rear end also receives an updated diffuser, air vents, and decklid, while the rear wing features redesigned side plates.\n\nThe 911 GT3 continues to house a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-six behind the rear axle, which Porsche says has been engineered to meet more stringent emissions regulations with two particulate filters and four catalytic converters. While power remains at 502 ponies, torque takes a dip from 346 to 331 pound-feet. Porsche says it maintained the horsepower output by implementing the camshaft profile from the 911 GT3 RS and revised cylinder heads, along with revised butterfly valves in the individual throttle bodies and new oil coolers.\n\nDon\'t worry; the 4.0-liter will still rev to 9000 rpm and can be paired with either a seven-speed PDK automatic or six-speed manual gearbox. Porsche says both transmissions have an 8 percent shorter final-drive ratio, a bid for quicker acceleration. GT3s with the PDK will zip from zero to 60 mph in a claimed 3.2 seconds, with a 193-mph top speed, while manual-equipped models will complete the same run in 3.7 ticks en route to a 195-mph top speed.\n\nFor 2025, Porsche altered the GT3\'s suspension using learnings from the more hardcore GT3 RS. The front ball joint on the lower trailing arm is now positioned lower on the front axle, which Porsche says creates an anti-dive effect to minimize pitching under braking. The GT3 uses teardrop-shaped trailing arms on the front axle that add downforce at high speeds, and the anti-dive changes also aim to keep a consistent aerodynamic balance.\n\nGT3 on a Diet\n\nThe 2025 GT3 also sheds weight, riding on new silver-colored aluminum wheels that decrease unsprung mass by 3.3 pounds. Porsche will also offer magnesium wheels, which shave off another 20 pounds, on the Weissach package. Porsche fitted a new 12-volt lithium-ion battery that cuts out 9.9 pounds versus the previous unit. The GT3 continues to roll on 255/35ZR-20 front tires and 315/30ZR-20 rear tires.\n\nInside, Porsche installed new lightweight bucket seats featuring a thorax airbag and powered height adjustment. The seat is also heated, and part of the headrest padding is removable for track driving with a helmet. A lightweight seat shell constructed of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is optional, as are more pedestrian 18-way power-adjustable sports seats.\n\nWhile the lower-priced 911 Carrera models have switched to a push-button start for 2025, the GT3 retains the classic rotary ignition switch. The digital gauge cluster can be switched into a Track Screen mode that only displays crucial driving data and flashes to indicate the ideal time to shift gears. The cabin also now includes a wireless charging pad, although it is probably most effective when not hurtling around a racetrack.\n\nThe GT3 Touring also returns for 2025, swapping the swan-neck rear wing for an active rear spoiler with a Gurney flap for a more low-key appearance, along with redesigned underbody strakes to balance the aerodynamics. Inside, Porsche has expanded the range of leather upholstery choices, and, at the request of customers, a rear seat is optional exclusively on the Touring model. The bucket seats have a folding backrest to improve access to the rear seats.\n\nPorsche is also introducing the Weissach package, previously exclusive to the GT3 RS, to the 2025 GT3. The anti-roll bar, coupling rods, and shear panel of the rear axle are fashioned from CFRP in the name of saving weight, and the material also appears on the roof, rear wing side plates, door handles, and side-view mirrors. The upper part of the dashboard gets wrapped in Race-Tex suede fabric to minimize glare.\n\nThe GT3 Touring is also offered with its own Lightweight package, gaining many of the same CFRP parts and also offering the Weissach package\'s forged magnesium wheels. Touring models equipped with the manual transmission utilize the shortened gear lever from the 911 S/T, and all cars with the Lightweight package display an interior plaque that reads "Leichtbau."\n\nOrders for the 2025 Porsche 911 GT3 will open at the end of this year, and the cars are expected to reach dealerships starting in the summer of 2025. The GT3 will cost \$224,495, representing a nearly \$40,000 increase over the base price of the 2024 model.',

    title: 'Michael Schumacher’s Last Ferrari F1 Car Can Be Yours',
    body:
        'He won five races and surpassed Ayrton Senna’s pole position record in this car.\n\nThe opportunity to buy a Formula 1 car doesn’t come around that often. Now you have the chance to put a very special example in your garage. RM Sotheby’s is selling one of Michael Schumacher’s most successful Ferrari F1 race cars, the 2006 Ferrari 248.\n\nSchumacher raced the Ferrari, chassis no. 254, to five victories, including the United States, European, and German Grand Prix. He also earned three second-place finishes, four fastest laps, and three pole positions in the car. In this chassis, Schumacher surpassed Ayrton Senna’s pole position record in 2006, his last year in the sport before retiring (for the first time).\n\nThe 248 was Ferrari’s first V-8 to power a Ferrari F1 car since 1964, with a 2.4-liter engine behind the driver. It initially made 730 horsepower, but was pumping out 785 hp by the end of the season.\n\nThe current owner bought the car from the Ferrari team in December 2007, and it received Ferrari Classiche Red Book certification in 2008, which confirmed its components had matching numbers. RM doesn’t list an estimated sale price, though it’s available upon request. The bidding opens on November 14.',

    title: 'You Can Still Buy a New Camaro. But Hurry, They\'re Almost Gone',
    body:
        'There are fewer than 100 new Camaros still on dealer lots.\n\nPour one out for the Chevrolet Camaro. The iconic pony car is heading to the big junkyard in the sky after production of the sixth-generation model ended last year. The final Camaro—a ZL1 with a stick—rolled off the line in Lansing last December, and as far as we know, there are no plans for a revival in sight.\n\nThat said, you can still get your hands on a brand-new Camaro before it\'s officially gone for good. There are still a handful of new examples lingering on dealer lots. But hurry, less than 100 remain.\n\nPerusing the inventory on Chevy\'s website (as noted by GM Authority), there are only 75 new 2024 Camaros and four 2023 Camaros at the time of writing. The variety ranges from base 1LT models to 2SS trims, with coupes and convertibles still available. As far as the inventory shows, though, there are no new ZL1 models. Sad!\n\nStill, getting into a new Camaro—even a base model—is no bad thing. The 1LT gets you a 3.6-liter V-6 engine with 335 horsepower and hopping into a new SS model unlocks a 6.2-liter V-8 with 455 horsepower. The bad news? There\'s only one manual still available in the entire country. The rest are all automatics.\n\nAll told, there are 35 3LT models still in inventory, 16 1LT models, 14 2LT models, 10 2SS models, and just one 1SS. The cheapest 1LT is available for just over \$33,000, while the cheapest SS—a 2023 1SS convertible—is available for just over \$55,000.\n\nSo if you want one of these still-new Camaros, you better hurry. They probably won\'t be around for much longer.',

    title: 'The Ferrari F80 Almost Didn\'t Have a Passenger Seat',
    body:
        'The original plan was to have a narrow cabin to give the hypercar extreme proportions.\n\nSupercars aren\'t about sharing the thrills with more than one passenger, but some automakers have made efforts to cram a third seat. McLaren\'s F1 and Speedtail along with the Gordon Murray T.50 spring to mind with their unusual 1+2 cabin layout. With the F80, Ferrari initially wanted to go in the opposite direction by making the interior all about the driver.\n\nSpeaking with Top Gear magazine, Maranello\'s design boss revealed the F80 was originally conceived strictly as a single-seater. The idea was to give the LaFerrari successor "really extreme proportions" by adopting an ultra-narrow cabin. The new flagship V-6 hybrid machine ultimately got a passenger seat but Flavio Manzoni says the Prancing Horse figured out how to make the interior feel like a single-seater without sacrificing the person riding shotgun.\n\nYou can even tell from the press images Ferrari seemingly wants to hide the passenger seat by making it black to blend with the rest of the cabin. Fixed in place to save weight, the passenger seat is positioned slightly farther back than the driver\'s seat. They did this to narrow the cabin without hampering ergonomics and comfort.\n\nAn even smaller cabin sans a passenger seat would\'ve enabled Ferrari to shave off more fat. Even so, the engineers managed to keep weight in check by extensively using carbon fiber. Before adding fluids, the F80 tips the scales at 3,362 pounds (1,525 kilograms).\n\nAlready sold out, the F80 wouldn\'t have been the first Ferrari without a passenger seat if they had stuck with the original plan. Back in 2018, the Monza SP1 was introduced as a single-seater, alongside a Monza SP2 that allowed a second person to hop inside the retro-flavored V-12 speedster. Last year, the 499P Modificata was launched as a track-only machine with just the driver\'s seat.\n\nThe vast majority of Ferraris have had two or four seats but there was a three-seater in 1966. Penned by Sergio Pininfarina, the unusual 365 P Berlinetta Speciale aka "Tre Posti" (Italian for three-seater) was initially a one-off affair. However, a second car, pictured above, was built following a request made by the Head of Fiat Gianni Agnelli.\n\nWith Ferrari having the Icona series reserved for ultra-exclusive cars like the Monza SP1, we won\'t be too surprised if there are plans for more limited-run models with unusual seating layouts. We\'re genuinely surprised wealthy people haven\'t offered Ferrari an obscene amount of money to build a real version of the Vision Gran Turismo, the futuristic single-seater designed specifically for the racing game. Well, maybe they did, and the company turned them down, but we\'re not in those elite circles to know what the rich folk want.',
