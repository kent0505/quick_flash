    title: 'Ferrari F80 succeeds LaFerrari with 1184bhp F1 V6 powertrain',
    body:
        'F1 and Le Mans inspired hypercar is the most powerful road-going Ferrari ever made\n\nFerrari’s long-awaited successor to the LaFerrari is the Italian marque’s most powerful road car to date, drawing 1184bhp from a wild electrified V6 powertrain that fuses technology from the firm’s Le Mans-winning 499P with that of its Formula 1 racing cars.\n\nNamed the F80, the new hypercar has been unveiled just weeks after McLaren revealed its own new halo model, the W1.\n\nThe F80 reignites the two manufacturers’ long–standing rivalry and reboots two-thirds of the iconic ‘Holy Trinity’ of hypercars from the early 2010s.\n\nThe new hypercar is priced from £3 million and limited to just 799 examples (all sold), and it follows in the footsteps of the F40, F50, Enzo and LaFerrari in rewriting the rulebook for a road-going Ferrari, while also being fitted with a host of tech that makes it a “new benchmark for innovation”.\n\nPowertrain\n\nAt the heart of the F80’s powertrain is a new version of Ferrari’s 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6. The engine can rev to 9200rpm and has been completely overhauled compared with the unit that powers the 296 GTB.\n\nParts from the 499P Le Mans car have been added to give it 888bhp in its own right, making it the most powerful engine Maranello has yet produced but no heavier than the 296’s engine.\n\nWorking in conjunction with the V6 engine are three electric motors: two on the front axle and one on the rear. Produced in-house (a first for Maranello), the front motors make 140bhp apiece, while the rear motor takes the form of an ‘MGU-K’ energy recovery unit.\n\nThe latter is similar in design to that found in the brand’s F1 cars and can recover as much as 94bhp through braking to automatically fill power gaps.\n\nFor the first time in a Ferrari, the F80 features ‘E-turbos’. Connected to an F1-derived ‘MGU-H’ heat recovery device, they have electric motors between the turbine and compressor to reduce lag and enhance throttle response.\n\nAll in, the powertrain sends a combined 1184bhp to all four wheels for a claimed 0-62mph in 2.15sec and 0-124mph in just 5.75sec. This trumps both the McLaren W1 and the Mercedes-AMG One.\n\nDifferent modes offer varying power levels, with Hybrid, Performance and Qualify selectable via the eManettino switch on the steering wheel.\n\nThere is no pure-electric mode, as on the 296, because the F80 is not a plug-in hybrid: its 2.3kWh battery serves to boost power and allows low-speed, short-distance engine-off running.\n\nWhile the default Hybrid mode optimises the powertrain for efficiency, Performance and Qualify modes give access to the F80’s Boost Optimisation function, which records the track during a sighting lap and then delivers power boosts when needed on the next pass – on straights or uphill sections, for example.',

        'BYD’s Yangwang U9 faces crucial Nürburgring lap test amid weather uncertainty',
    body:
        'BYD’s Yangwang U9 (see specs) supercar is today facing a pivotal lap-time test at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. Recent weather challenges, including multiple rain-induced track closures, have heightened the tension as the engineering team makes final preparations. The team remains cautiously optimistic as dawn breaks, hoping for better conditions to prove the U9’s capabilities, the company says.\n\nAs we reported back in August, Yangwang has conducted extensive performance tests at the Nürburgring, often called the world’s most challenging circuit, for over six months. The Nürburgring is known for its demanding layout, sharp elevation changes, and corners. During this period, the U9 underwent rigorous trials, including evaluating over 100 technical configurations and nearly 100 different tire setups. The U9, built entirely using Yangwang’s proprietary technology, has been fine-tuned in preparation for this critical test, meeting the expectations of the company and its dedicated supporters.\n\nPriced at 1.68 million yuan (around 236,000 USD), the U9 is a high-performance electric supercar featuring a carbon fiber roof and rear diffuser for enhanced aerodynamics. With a length of 4,966 mm, width of 2,029 mm, and height of 1,295 mm, its wheelbase stretches to 2,900 mm, while its weight stands at 2,475 kg. An optional racing spoiler adds to its track-focused design.\n\nThe U9 is powered by BYD’s e⁴ U-shaped motor system, delivering 1,680 Nm of peak torque through four motors, achieving a top speed of 375.12 km/h. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.36 seconds and completes the 0-400 meter sprint in 9.78 seconds. Its 80 kWh battery offers a 450 km range under the CLTC cycle, with fast charging options allowing a 30% to 80% recharge in 10 minutes, while a full slow charge takes 7 hours.\n\nEquipped with the DiSus-X suspension and stabilization system, the U9 can perform remarkable maneuvers, including driving on three wheels, jumping, and executing dynamic stunts. This reflects Yangwang’s commitment to pushing engineering limits.\n\nAt the track, four U9 prototypes have been thoroughly inspected and are ready at the T13 starting point for today’s test. The results of today’s test could represent a significant milestone for Yangwang’s development of the U9, which aims to solidify its status as a top-tier electric supercar. We will keep you posted on further updates.',

        'Limited-edition Mercedes G-Class Past II Future celebrates 45 years of iconic 4x4',
    body:
        'Just 20 examples will be made, featuring retro details and modern six-cylinder power\n\nA lot has changed in the 45 years since the original Mercedes G-Class came down from the Schöckl mountain and was introduced to the world, and the new ultra-limited-edition G-Class Past II Future celebrates this timeless quality of the iconic 4x4.\n\nThe new version comes in a unique olive green and grey two-tone paint scheme, which is contrasted by the fully black front end, including grille and bumpers, plus black alloy wheels, wheelarch cladding and side steps.\n\nMeanwhile the trim running along the length of the car features a special message: “This G-Class is dedicated to those who celebrate invention. The disruptors. The pioneers. The collaborators. To those who explored the past and drive the future with passion, wisdom and vision.”\n\nThe interior gets chequered seat upholstery, which is a nod to the patterns found in earlier G-Class models. There’s also ‘Past II Future’ lettering on the dashboard’s grab handle, and ‘one of 20’ inscribed on the centre console.\n\nEvery model gets a 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine with mild-hybrid assistance, but customers will be able to choose from the diesel G 450 d with 362bhp and the petrol G 500 with 442bhp. Both send their power through a nine-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels.\n\nOnly 20 examples of the G-Class Past II Future will be made, and while Mercedes hasn’t announced how much they cost, it’ll start delivering the cars to their owners in April 2025.\n\nOne-off Project G-Class Past II Future ‘art piece’\n\nThe design and interior treatment for the limited edition G-Class is inspired by a one-piece ‘art piece’ that Mercedes created with the help of luxury fashion brand Moncler and Japanese designer NIGO. It’s also part of the G-Wagen’s 45th anniversary celebrations, and is based on a fully restored cabriolet model from the nineties.\n\nIn place of a fabric roof, the ‘Project G-Class Past II Future’ has a quilted design similar to a Moncler puffer jacket. Other interesting details include black steel wheels in a nineties design, plus a gold-coloured fuel can on the back along with the familiar spare wheel, and a sound system that uses removable boom boxes.\n\n',

        '1989 Mercedes-Benz 300TE For Sale on Bring a Trailer Has Hollywood and Diplomatic History',
    body:
        'Shirley Temple, the iconic child actress of the 1930s and 1940s, is famous for many things. The song On the Good Ship Lollipop. Tap-dancing with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson. The teeth-crackingly sweet non-alcoholic drink that bore her name—a limited-edition commercial version of which has just been launched under the 7Up brand. But perhaps you didn\'t know that Shirley was the U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and you may be surprised to see what she brought back with her from that work.\n\nIt\'s this 1989 Mercedes-Benz 300TE wagon, which is now up for auction on Bring a Trailer (which, like Car and Driver, is part of the Hearst Autos). Built at a time when Mercedes cars were famously over-engineered, the W124 series (wagon models carry the S124 codename) is a masterpiece. This example is a utilitarian spec not offered in the United States, with crank windows, manual seats, and cloth upholstery. The smooth and durable inline-six is paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. Finished in light ivory, it could have been a taxicab in Europe (many were), but the U.S. diplomatic flag on the right front fender tells a different story.\n\nMarried in 1950 and thus now Shirley Temple Black, this was Shirley\'s personal vehicle right through her three years as U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.\n\nHer path to politics started with Henry Kissinger, who ended up convincing Richard Nixon to appoint her as a delegate to the UN in 1969. Later, George H.W. Bush appointed her Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, a position she may have sought because she happened to be in Prague in 1968 when the Soviet tanks came rolling in to crush dissent. While Ambassador, Temple Black championed anti-communist activists and was part of establishing formal diplomatic relations with the democratically elected government of Václev Havel. She personally accompanied Havel to the U.S. for his first visit.\n\nThe 300TE was brought into the States in the early 1990s and federalized at what must have been considerable expense. Shirley owned this car until she died in 2014, so she clearly had some affection for it. After a young life spent in the very public spotlight, the 300TE\'s subtlety must have let her pass unnoticed, besides being associated with her foreign service days.\n\nCelebrity cars are a funny business, as simply being owned by a famous person can add tremendously to a car\'s value—or not at all. There\'s no reserve on the auction, so the market will decide whether the Shirley Temple ownership bring a premium, but regardless, someone is going to go home with a Mercedes that has a great story attached to it.And once they do, they can load the cargo area with a crate of 7 Up\'s new Shirley Temple softdrink. Here\'s to you, Shirley.\n\nThe auction ends on October 23.',

    title: '2025 Porsche 911 GT3 Still Makes 502 HP, Gains Weissach Package',
    body:
        'Porsche\'s track-ready 911 sports car receives several small upgrades for 2025, from a revised suspension to a new lightweight package and optional rear seats.\n\nThe 2025 Porsche 911 GT3 wears revised styling and is now offered with the lightweight Weissach package.\n\nThe 4.0-liter flat-six still pumps out 502 horsepower, but torque drops from 346 pound-feet to 331.\n\nDeliveries will start next summer, with the base price rising by nearly \$40,000 to \$224,495.\n\nPorsche sprinkled the iconic 911 sports car with a handful of styling changes for 2025, along with introducing a hybrid powertrain for the first time in the GTS model. Now Porsche is updating the track-ready 911 GT3 with similarly sharp looks, revised suspension, and new lightweight bucket seats. For the first time, Porsche will also offer the GT3 with the weight-saving Weissach package.\n\nBusiness as Usual\n\nThe design changes, in typical Porsche fashion, are subtle. The front end has been tweaked with a new spoiler and underbody fins to increase downforce, and the LED headlights are restyled and can be ordered with a white accent ring. Porsche also consolidated all of the lighting functions into the main headlight unit so there is no longer a supplemental LED strip in the bumper, allowing for a larger air intake. The rear end also receives an updated diffuser, air vents, and decklid, while the rear wing features redesigned side plates.\n\nThe 911 GT3 continues to house a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-six behind the rear axle, which Porsche says has been engineered to meet more stringent emissions regulations with two particulate filters and four catalytic converters. While power remains at 502 ponies, torque takes a dip from 346 to 331 pound-feet. Porsche says it maintained the horsepower output by implementing the camshaft profile from the 911 GT3 RS and revised cylinder heads, along with revised butterfly valves in the individual throttle bodies and new oil coolers.\n\nDon\'t worry; the 4.0-liter will still rev to 9000 rpm and can be paired with either a seven-speed PDK automatic or six-speed manual gearbox. Porsche says both transmissions have an 8 percent shorter final-drive ratio, a bid for quicker acceleration. GT3s with the PDK will zip from zero to 60 mph in a claimed 3.2 seconds, with a 193-mph top speed, while manual-equipped models will complete the same run in 3.7 ticks en route to a 195-mph top speed.\n\nFor 2025, Porsche altered the GT3\'s suspension using learnings from the more hardcore GT3 RS. The front ball joint on the lower trailing arm is now positioned lower on the front axle, which Porsche says creates an anti-dive effect to minimize pitching under braking. The GT3 uses teardrop-shaped trailing arms on the front axle that add downforce at high speeds, and the anti-dive changes also aim to keep a consistent aerodynamic balance.\n\nGT3 on a Diet\n\nThe 2025 GT3 also sheds weight, riding on new silver-colored aluminum wheels that decrease unsprung mass by 3.3 pounds. Porsche will also offer magnesium wheels, which shave off another 20 pounds, on the Weissach package. Porsche fitted a new 12-volt lithium-ion battery that cuts out 9.9 pounds versus the previous unit. The GT3 continues to roll on 255/35ZR-20 front tires and 315/30ZR-20 rear tires.\n\nInside, Porsche installed new lightweight bucket seats featuring a thorax airbag and powered height adjustment. The seat is also heated, and part of the headrest padding is removable for track driving with a helmet. A lightweight seat shell constructed of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is optional, as are more pedestrian 18-way power-adjustable sports seats.\n\nWhile the lower-priced 911 Carrera models have switched to a push-button start for 2025, the GT3 retains the classic rotary ignition switch. The digital gauge cluster can be switched into a Track Screen mode that only displays crucial driving data and flashes to indicate the ideal time to shift gears. The cabin also now includes a wireless charging pad, although it is probably most effective when not hurtling around a racetrack.\n\nThe GT3 Touring also returns for 2025, swapping the swan-neck rear wing for an active rear spoiler with a Gurney flap for a more low-key appearance, along with redesigned underbody strakes to balance the aerodynamics. Inside, Porsche has expanded the range of leather upholstery choices, and, at the request of customers, a rear seat is optional exclusively on the Touring model. The bucket seats have a folding backrest to improve access to the rear seats.\n\nPorsche is also introducing the Weissach package, previously exclusive to the GT3 RS, to the 2025 GT3. The anti-roll bar, coupling rods, and shear panel of the rear axle are fashioned from CFRP in the name of saving weight, and the material also appears on the roof, rear wing side plates, door handles, and side-view mirrors. The upper part of the dashboard gets wrapped in Race-Tex suede fabric to minimize glare.\n\nThe GT3 Touring is also offered with its own Lightweight package, gaining many of the same CFRP parts and also offering the Weissach package\'s forged magnesium wheels. Touring models equipped with the manual transmission utilize the shortened gear lever from the 911 S/T, and all cars with the Lightweight package display an interior plaque that reads "Leichtbau."\n\nOrders for the 2025 Porsche 911 GT3 will open at the end of this year, and the cars are expected to reach dealerships starting in the summer of 2025. The GT3 will cost \$224,495, representing a nearly \$40,000 increase over the base price of the 2024 model.',

    body:
        'He won five races and surpassed Ayrton Senna’s pole position record in this car.\n\nThe opportunity to buy a Formula 1 car doesn’t come around that often. Now you have the chance to put a very special example in your garage. RM Sotheby’s is selling one of Michael Schumacher’s most successful Ferrari F1 race cars, the 2006 Ferrari 248.\n\nSchumacher raced the Ferrari, chassis no. 254, to five victories, including the United States, European, and German Grand Prix. He also earned three second-place finishes, four fastest laps, and three pole positions in the car. In this chassis, Schumacher surpassed Ayrton Senna’s pole position record in 2006, his last year in the sport before retiring (for the first time).\n\nThe 248 was Ferrari’s first V-8 to power a Ferrari F1 car since 1964, with a 2.4-liter engine behind the driver. It initially made 730 horsepower, but was pumping out 785 hp by the end of the season.\n\nThe current owner bought the car from the Ferrari team in December 2007, and it received Ferrari Classiche Red Book certification in 2008, which confirmed its components had matching numbers. RM doesn’t list an estimated sale price, though it’s available upon request. The bidding opens on November 14.',

    body:
        'There are fewer than 100 new Camaros still on dealer lots.\n\nPour one out for the Chevrolet Camaro. The iconic pony car is heading to the big junkyard in the sky after production of the sixth-generation model ended last year. The final Camaro—a ZL1 with a stick—rolled off the line in Lansing last December, and as far as we know, there are no plans for a revival in sight.\n\nThat said, you can still get your hands on a brand-new Camaro before it\'s officially gone for good. There are still a handful of new examples lingering on dealer lots. But hurry, less than 100 remain.\n\nPerusing the inventory on Chevy\'s website (as noted by GM Authority), there are only 75 new 2024 Camaros and four 2023 Camaros at the time of writing. The variety ranges from base 1LT models to 2SS trims, with coupes and convertibles still available. As far as the inventory shows, though, there are no new ZL1 models. Sad!\n\nStill, getting into a new Camaro—even a base model—is no bad thing. The 1LT gets you a 3.6-liter V-6 engine with 335 horsepower and hopping into a new SS model unlocks a 6.2-liter V-8 with 455 horsepower. The bad news? There\'s only one manual still available in the entire country. The rest are all automatics.\n\nAll told, there are 35 3LT models still in inventory, 16 1LT models, 14 2LT models, 10 2SS models, and just one 1SS. The cheapest 1LT is available for just over \$33,000, while the cheapest SS—a 2023 1SS convertible—is available for just over \$55,000.\n\nSo if you want one of these still-new Camaros, you better hurry. They probably won\'t be around for much longer.',

    title: 'The Ferrari F80 Almost Didn\'t Have a Passenger Seat',
    body:
        'The original plan was to have a narrow cabin to give the hypercar extreme proportions.\n\nSupercars aren\'t about sharing the thrills with more than one passenger, but some automakers have made efforts to cram a third seat. McLaren\'s F1 and Speedtail along with the Gordon Murray T.50 spring to mind with their unusual 1+2 cabin layout. With the F80, Ferrari initially wanted to go in the opposite direction by making the interior all about the driver.\n\nSpeaking with Top Gear magazine, Maranello\'s design boss revealed the F80 was originally conceived strictly as a single-seater. The idea was to give the LaFerrari successor "really extreme proportions" by adopting an ultra-narrow cabin. The new flagship V-6 hybrid machine ultimately got a passenger seat but Flavio Manzoni says the Prancing Horse figured out how to make the interior feel like a single-seater without sacrificing the person riding shotgun.\n\nYou can even tell from the press images Ferrari seemingly wants to hide the passenger seat by making it black to blend with the rest of the cabin. Fixed in place to save weight, the passenger seat is positioned slightly farther back than the driver\'s seat. They did this to narrow the cabin without hampering ergonomics and comfort.\n\nAn even smaller cabin sans a passenger seat would\'ve enabled Ferrari to shave off more fat. Even so, the engineers managed to keep weight in check by extensively using carbon fiber. Before adding fluids, the F80 tips the scales at 3,362 pounds (1,525 kilograms).\n\nAlready sold out, the F80 wouldn\'t have been the first Ferrari without a passenger seat if they had stuck with the original plan. Back in 2018, the Monza SP1 was introduced as a single-seater, alongside a Monza SP2 that allowed a second person to hop inside the retro-flavored V-12 speedster. Last year, the 499P Modificata was launched as a track-only machine with just the driver\'s seat.\n\nThe vast majority of Ferraris have had two or four seats but there was a three-seater in 1966. Penned by Sergio Pininfarina, the unusual 365 P Berlinetta Speciale aka "Tre Posti" (Italian for three-seater) was initially a one-off affair. However, a second car, pictured above, was built following a request made by the Head of Fiat Gianni Agnelli.\n\nWith Ferrari having the Icona series reserved for ultra-exclusive cars like the Monza SP1, we won\'t be too surprised if there are plans for more limited-run models with unusual seating layouts. We\'re genuinely surprised wealthy people haven\'t offered Ferrari an obscene amount of money to build a real version of the Vision Gran Turismo, the futuristic single-seater designed specifically for the racing game. Well, maybe they did, and the company turned them down, but we\'re not in those elite circles to know what the rich folk want.',

    title: 'McLaren W1 First Look: Say Hello to McLaren’s New Halo Hypercar',
    body:
        'Get to know everything about the new McLaren W1 hypercar, including specs, price, and more.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of McLaren winning its first Formula 1 World Championship, it is officially debuting its newest hypercar, the McLaren W1. To say the W1 has been highly anticipated would be an understatement. The new hypercar can draw its lineage straight back to the legendary McLaren F1 of the early \'90s, and it is the direct successor to the McLaren P1. Those are big wheels to fill, to say the least. Let’s dive into McLaren’s newest halo car.\n\nMcLaren’s Most Powerful Engine\n\nJust behind the driver’s seat in the W1 is the most powerful engine McLaren has ever produced. Though, to be fair, we would expect nothing else from a car that’s meant to take over as the top dog. Like the P1 before it, the McLaren W1 has a hybrid powertrain blending a 4.0-liter 90-degree V-8 and an “E-Module” that has a radial flux electric motor. If the term “radial flux” sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the same technology Koenigsegg uses in the “Dark Matter” electric motor in the Gemera.\n\nThe flat-plane-crank V-8 engine, which McLaren calls the MHP-8, makes 916 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. The electric motor adds another 342 hp and 324 lb-ft, bringing the grand total to 1,258 hp and 988 lb-ft of torque. The McLaren W1 sends every hoof of that horsepower to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and electronic locking differential.\n\nFor those who don’t feel like doing the math, the W1 has a 354-hp and 324-lb-ft advantage over its predecessor, the P1. The W1’s V-8 alone makes as much torque as the entire P1’s hybrid powertrain.\n\nElectrify All the Things\n\nThe McLaren W1’s E-Module is fed by a dielectric immersion-cooled 1.384-kWh battery with “motorsport-derived” cells, according to McLaren. The W1 keeps the battery at a minimum level of charge so that it can crank the motor, and—get this—reverse the car. That’s right, the McLaren W1 has an electric reverse gear called “E-reverse.” This sounds wild, but most Toyota hybrids have been operating this way for years—using one of their electric motors spun the other way to move backward.\n\nThe entire E-Module (the radial flux electric motor and integrated motor control unit) weighs just 44 pounds and mounts to the side of the transmission.\n\nThe McLaren W1 can be driven in electric-only mode, but as you may have guessed by the size of the battery, it can’t go very far. All-electric range is just 1.6 miles, which will get you far enough from the neighbors so that they don’t complain when the V-8 kicks in.\n\nWait, who are we kidding? Anyone who can afford this car either has enough private land that their nearest neighbor couldn’t hear them, or their neighbors also have hypercars that are just as loud.\n\nAll About Airflow\n\nConsidering what McLaren does on the weekends, it\'s no surprise that it put a massive effort into the W1’s aerodynamic design. McLaren says the W1’s aerodynamic platform is the most advanced its ever created for a road car. The final design comes after over 350 hours of wind tunnel sessions and 5,000 metrics tested.\n\nEverything hangs on what McLaren calls the Aerocell monocoque, the shape of which is meant to facilitate the W1\'s ground effects. As you might be able to see in the interior images, the seats are integrated into the monocoque in a similar way to a Formula 1 car. McLaren says integrating the seats in that way saved it 2.8 inches in wheelbase requirement. Like the F1 and P1 before, the W1\'s driving position is changed by moving the pedal box in the raised footwell.\n\nThe Aerocell also allows for the W1’s anhedral doors, which is a first for the automaker. McLaren chose the door design to help the W1 stay within its aerodynamic requirements. Doors that hinge from the roof are the only doors that would work with what the automaker set out to accomplish. It also reduces the size of the side window drop glass for the same reason. Doing this helps optimize the airflow from the front wheel arches into the radiators. It\'s not all function... While McLaren’s designers were at it, they shaped the doors to be reminiscent of the McLaren MCL38 F1 car’s silhouette.\n\nTo make the W1 even more slippery, the driver can activate a race mode, which lowers the ride height 1.46 inches in the front and 0.7 inch in the rear. In this mode, the W1 can generate 772 pounds of downforce at the front and 1,433 pounds of downforce at the rear. That’s a total of 2,205 pounds of downforce on tap in high-speed corners.\n\nThe W1’s long rear wing can be electrically actuated via four motors that move it up, down, and up to 11.8 inches rearward, as well as changing the pitch.\n\nThe front splitter is actuated by two electric motors and can create a full-width frontal aerodynamic surface which feeds air under the car to the F1-style T-tray.',

        'Ford\'s Tesla Supercharger Adapter Detailed: Availability, Tech Specs, and More',
    body:
        'This handy little device enables Ford EVs to plug into Tesla\'s Supercharger network of charging stations.\n\nIn the not-to-distant future, brand-new Ford EVs will come from the factory equipped with the same NACS charge ports that Tesla uses, meaning they\'ll be able to plug into Tesla chargers—faster Superchargers and Level 2 destination chargers—without any special adapters. (In fact, they\'ll need adapters to work with current CCS1 DC fast chargers and the like!) Until then, Ford has unveiled the Fast Charging adapter owners of its Mach-E SUV, F-150 Lighting pickup, and (eventually) E-Transit van will need to plug into Tesla\'s Superchargers—a device that opens up 15,000 new fast chargers to Ford owners after today.\n\nCurrent owners of Mach-Es and Lightnings will receive over-the-air (OTA) updates this morning that enable them to charge at select Tesla Superchargers nationwide; E-Transits will require in-person updates, as the electric vans don\'t support OTAs, but also will eventually be compatible with Tesla\'s DC fast chargers. Of course, all three electric Fords will also need the NACS-to-CCS1 adapter you see here. And for now, that adapter is free to Ford owners (one per car).\n\nOwners (and anyone who buys a new Ford EV in the next few months) have until June 30, 2024 to order their free adapters via a Ford.com/FastChargingAdapter; after that date, Ford says the adapter will be available for purchase. The retail price is \$230, though Ford isn\'t being specific yet as to whether that\'ll also apply to customers buying one at the same time they purchase a new Ford EV, or whether such customers might receive a discount of some kind. One thing\'s for sure: The complimentary aspect is done after June 30.\n\nSince the adapter itself has no communications tech onboard, it can be used with non-Ford products, provided those cars and trucks use CCS1 ports and are software-compatible with Tesla\'s Superchargers, meaning customers who drive non-Ford vehicles that Tesla has opened its Supercharger network to can use this adapter. At least for Ford vehicles, the adapter won\'t be a limiting factor in charge speeds; it\'s rated at 1,000 volts DC and 300 amps regularly and up to 500 amps boost current for up to ten minutes at a time. A built-in temperature sensor can throttle charging speeds or "interrupt charging as necessary," essentially to cool things off if needed.\n\nAnother key consideration for would-be adapter users: It only works on Tesla\'s Superchargers, not Level 2 destination or home chargers. It\'s specifically for DC fast charging, not lower-speed AC charging, on the Mach-E, Lightning, and E-Transit. Also, not every Tesla Supercharger is compatible—older V2 models are out, as are non-upgraded V3 versions. This will require some digging on the Ford owner\'s part, because for now, the automaker is still working to integrate compatible Superchargers with Google Maps, Apple Maps, and its onboard navigation systems\' EV route planning protocols—the software that routes you to chargers. That functionality is coming soon.\n\nFord won\'t be shipping the adapters—even those ordered today—until later in March, so there\'s time to sort that little bugaboo out before customers actually receive the hardware necessary to use those Tesla Supercharger stations. When customers receive them and start using them, the charging process at Superchargers will be seamless. There is no need to get the Tesla app, either—the Superchargers are now effectively part of Ford\'s "Blue Oval" charge network, meaning they work with the Plug and Charge single-payment setup (so, no need for a bevy of individual apps for different charging networks) for public charging via the FordPass or the Public Charging app can pull up to a charger, plug in, and that\'s it. With the addition of Tesla\'s Superchargers, Ford\'s Blue Oval network now comprises 126,000-plus chargers at 35,000 locations, 28,000 of which are DC fast chargers at 7,500 locations.',

    title: 'The Nissan GT-R Is Dead After 17 Years',
    body:
        'An impressive automotive kaiju when new, it speaks to Godzilla’s technological prowess that the same chassis made it to its teenage years.\n\nIt’s a day we knew, eventually, would come. But did anyone imagine it would take 17 years to arrive? Nissan has announced the final R35-generation Nissan GT-R, which will bow out with two model-year 2024 special editions: the 2024 Nissan GT-R T-spec Takumi Edition and the Skyline Edition. Both will retail for north of \$130k, and who knows if dealers will take advantage of their “final special edition” status to milk a few more bucks from customers.\n\nWe’ll say one thing: Nissan sure milked some longevity from the R35 chassis itself. The R35 debuted for the 2008 model year (in the U.S. as a 2009 model), with absolutely staggering performance figures and a somewhat polarizing focus on computer-enhanced hardware. Under the hood, the inline-six of previous generations was replaced by a VQ-series V-6 displacing 3.8 liters and breathing a ton of boost from twin IHI turbochargers. The initial GT-R made (an understated) 480 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque—monumental numbers for the time—and lunged to 60 mph in our testing in just 3.2 seconds on the way to a 11.6 quarter.\n\nThe R35 was (and is) impressively, and imposingly, complex. Its wild all-wheel-drive system takes a “complicate and add driveshafts” approach to its engineering, sending power from its front-mounted engine back to a rear-mounted transaxle, then sending it forward again through a second driveshaft to the front differential.\n\nOver more than a decade-and-a-half, Nissan wouldn’t leave the GT-R alone. It kept adding power, increasing the GT-R’s performance—and its price. The 2015 Nissan GT-R NISMO, for example, was boosted to 600 hp, 481 lb-ft, a 0–60 time of 2.9 seconds, and a flat 11-second quarter. The GT-Rs could handle, too, with the NISMO running a 22.9-second figure-eight time in our testing.\n\nThe R35 was so impressive when new, so novel and ferocious, it took our 2009 MotorTrend Car of the Year award. As we summed it up at the time, "Plainly put: No Nissan has ever been as formidable or as awesome as the GT-R. More significant, no other 2009 contender crushes our criteria like the GT-R. For that, it wholeheartedly deserves our Golden Calipers.”\n\nSo how do these special editions send the R35 off? The Takumi Edition, Nissan says, pays tribute to the takumi (master craftsman) that hand-assemble the GT-R. It features a gold VIN plate in the engine bay, acknowledging the takumi with red-etched script. Nissan says the engines of these models are balanced to a higher degree, although the specifics are vague. More importantly to enthusiasts, the Takumi Edition rocks a Midnight Purple paint job, a color that resonates deeply in Godzilla lore. The interior trim is Mori Green. A few upgraded parts abound: GT-R NISMO carbon-ceramic brakes, gold-painted 20-inch Rays wheels from the NISMO, wider front fenders, and a specially tuned Vehicle Dynamic Control System (also tuned by NISMO). The Takumi Edition will MSRP for \$152,985.\n\nMeanwhile, the Skyline Edition is a little less expensive, painted in Bayside Blue with a Sora Blue interior. Bayside Blue, Nissan tells us, was retired after the legendary R34 Skyline GT-R bowed out, but was revived in 2019 as a 50th Anniversary Edition color. Now it’s back, as a send-off color. The Skyline Edition doesn’t appear to have any other changes. It retails for \$132,985.\n\nNissan has been loudly whispering to the internet that it’s not done with the GT-R, or a GT-R like vehicle, at some point in the future. Nissan says to expect a “next era of exciting innovation in performance.” We hope that it builds on the R35 legacy in the right way.\n\n',
